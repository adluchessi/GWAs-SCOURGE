Here you can find scripts to prepare GWAS summary statistics and genotype-level files to perform fine-mapping analysis with FINEMAP.

Given that the program considers genotype dosages when calculating LD among SNPs, the genotype files need to be adapted using LDStore: http://www.christianbenner.com/#

Step 1: define the regions to FINEMAP -- here I used +/- 500 kilobases of each lead or top SNP from the GWAS.

Step 2: create subsets of the GWAS summary statistics including only the top SNP +/- 500kb -- you can use the 'get-1Mb-regions.sh' script to create subsets.

Step 3: create subsets of the genotype files including only the top SNP +/- kb and convert it to BGEN format -- using the 'get-bgen-subset-files.sh' script.

Step 4: index BGEN files -- with the 'index-bgen.sh' script.

Step 5: create master files for LDstore and FINEMAP -- check LDstore/FINEMAP website for details. I have copied one example of each in this directory. 
        Important to note that these files must be in unix format. So if you generated them with a Windows text editor, you'll need to convert them. This can be done using
        'dos2unix.exe' which is available in the Git shell. Additionally, be careful of not leaving spaces at the end of a row or blank rows at the end of the file,
        which will output errors!

Step 6: calculate LD among SNPs on each subset using LDstore -- using the 'run-LDstore.sh' script. Some common errors are due to blank spaces/typos in the masterfile, or due to
        the GWAS summary statistics and BGEN files not having a full overlap. Be sure to check the ldstore.err output and also the ldstore.out for details if something went wrong.
        Also helpful to check the size of the 'bcor' files if they are generated (with ls -l command). If empty, then is likely that is due to not full overlap.

Step 7: run FINEMAP on each subset.
