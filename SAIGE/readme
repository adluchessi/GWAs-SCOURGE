The program can be installed in Compute Canada (I have done it in Graham) as a docker image by using the script 'install-SAIGE.sh'

The program for running a GWAS consists on two steps (i.e. two functions). Sample scripts for each step are in 'saige-step1.sh' and 'saige-step2.sh'

Check the FAQ for different options of imputed genotype files. In my experience, SAIGE does not recognize the INFO flag for imputation score (Sanger Imputation Server) in VCF files,
thus I had to convert the VCF imputed files to bgen files first (using plink2).
