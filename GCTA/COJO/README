Scripts to run conditional analysis of association (COJO) using summary statistics and a genotype file as LD reference.

Check out the website to adapt your summary statistics in the correct format. Specifically regarding the effect allele.
On SAIGE, the effect allele is A2, whereas in GCTA-MLMA the effect allele is A1.
The LD reference genotype file is a plink binary file of imputed genotypes with a high INFO threshold (0.8 or 0.9).
The p-value threshold used is normally 5e-8, but can be changed. There are other options to include in the analysis, which you can check out on the software's website.

After running the analysis with 'run-COJO.sh', you can merge the results for the chromosomes for which there are significant signals with 'post-COJO.sh'.
