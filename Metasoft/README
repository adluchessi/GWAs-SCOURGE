METASOFT is used to run meta-analysis, and the summary statistics for each study included need to be formatted first.

This can be done by using the 'pre-meta-step1.sh' and 'pre-meta-step2.sh', followed by the run-meta.sh script.
Similar to running GWAS, there is afterwards a script to get clean files 'post-meta.sh'.
Note: I've been having issues accesing Metasoft website since a few months ago!

For 'pre-meta-step2.sh' you may use the python script uploaded in this subdirectory 'plink2metasoft2.py', which is compatible with python 3.8 (whereas the original python script is compatible with old python versions).
