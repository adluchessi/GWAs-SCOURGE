This directory contains a sample script to run SNPTEST, which can be run in the Calculon (UTM) server, one chromosome at a time (using arrays).

It also contains three scripts to wrangle the raw output from SNPTEST to obtain clean files (post-snptest). The output files are a bit different between binary and quantitative
